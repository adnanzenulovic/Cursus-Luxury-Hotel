# Cursus-Luxury-Hotel

I developed a web application for hotel management written in PHP. The application provides a view of rooms with details and descriptions, as well as a reservation feature. There are two levels of access: user and administrator. While users can view and book rooms, the administrator has the ability to add new rooms and access analytical data about site usage.
